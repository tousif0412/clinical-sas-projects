# 🧪 Clinical Study Overview

This document summarizes key components of a clinical study and industry standards used in statistical programming.

---

## 🎯 Study Objectives
**Primary Objective**
- Evaluate the efficacy of the study treatment compared to placebo/QC comparator.

**Secondary Objectives**
- Assess safety and tolerability through adverse events, laboratory tests, and vital signs.
- Support baseline comparability across treatment arms.

---

## 🧬 Study Design
- **Type:** Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled
- **Arms/Groups:** 2 (Treatment vs Placebo)
- **Design Model:** Parallel-group
- **Randomization:** Subjects assigned randomly to study arms to avoid bias.
- **Blinding:** Neither subjects nor investigators know treatment allocation.
- **Visit Type:** Scheduled + Unscheduled visits
- **Scope:** Multicenter / Multinational possible

---

## 👥 Analysis Populations (Clinical Study Flags)
| Population | Description | Common ADaM Flag |
|---|---|---|
| ITT / FAS | All randomized subjects | `FASFL / ITTFL` |
| Safety Population | Received ≥1 dose | `SAFFL` |
| Per Protocol | Completed study without major deviation | `PPFL` |

---

## 📌 Study Endpoints
**Primary Endpoint**
- Measures treatment efficacy (e.g., clinical outcome change from baseline).

**Safety Endpoints**
- **Adverse Events:** AE / SAE
- **Labs:** Hematology, Biochemistry, etc.
- **Vitals:** BP, Pulse, Temperature, Weight, etc.

## 📊 CDISC Standards Used in Reporting
### 📁 SDTM (Study Data Tabulation Model)
Common domains:
- `DM` – Demographics
- `AE` – Adverse Events
- `VS` – Vital Signs
- `LB` – Laboratory
- `EX` – Exposure
- `CM` – Concomitant Medications

### 📁 ADaM (Analysis Data Model)
Core datasets:
- `ADSL` – Subject Level
- `ADAE` – AE Analysis
- `ADVS` – Vitals Analysis
- `ADLB` – Lab Analysis

### 📘 TLF (Tables, Listings, Figures)
**Tables**
1. Demographic characteristics (Age, Sex, Race, BMI, Height, Weight)
2. Baseline comparison across arms

**Listings**
1. Informed Consent Records
2. Subject Demographics
3. AE/SAE details

**Figures**
1. Distribution of Hematology/Lab values by Treatment
2. Vital trends or highlighted values

---

## ❗ Missing Data Handling
Common imputation techniques:
- `LOCF` – Last Observation Carried Forward
- Baseline carry forward rules (as per SAP)

---

## 🧠 Tools & Skills Applied
- **SAS Programming:** Base SAS, SQL, Macros, Job Flows
- **Clinical QC Tools:** CDISC SDTM/ADaM validation concepts
- **Reporting:** TLF planning and structure for CSR/Interview showcase
